# RoadMap
- Optimize the usage of API to fetch dataset from Services [NodeJS, other efficient Cloud services]. Currently in Local JSON data.
- Auto Search of Related Images based on the Meme Text Context
- Show Icon sized selected Images before Preview
- Meme Preview -> Code has been enabled as different Images integrated in Carousel, but 3-4 standard template component to render images and text
Share Instead of Save
- One custom template component enabling drag & drop of images and edit on the fly. 
- Eliminate the need to use 3rd Party as much as possible. (Long term â€“ not immediate)
